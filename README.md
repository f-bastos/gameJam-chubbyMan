# Game Jam - Chubby Man

Our first group project at Code for All Bootcamp @ Porto, with 4 weeks of coding experience!  
We were challenged to create a game in 9 days and 10 nights applying the technologies we had learned the previous weeks.

Our game was based on the famous PacMan game, but here we have ChubbyMan and his goal is to eat all the cakes on the time available.  
We implemented the features (grid, movement and collision, audio effects, graphic elements and user interface) mostly in pair programming, with extra details being coded individually.

Tech && Methodologies: Java, OOP, SimpleGFX Library, Intelli J IDEA, Apache Ant
